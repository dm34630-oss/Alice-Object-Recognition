# Alice-Object-Recognition
An object recognition software inspired by KAYA Vision Cameras. This software can currently detect 60 objects, and requires 2 different webcams to successfully run. This was made by a partial custom made LLM I've been working on called AL1-TP1, also known as Alice. IF you want to load a custom model, you'll need to train it and import it into TF.js
